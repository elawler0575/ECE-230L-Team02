## Lab Questions

###  Why can we not just use structural Verilog to implement latches?
In structural Verilog, the assignment is continuous meaning it tries to assign everything at once. When the assign statements have variables that are used in one assign statement and is the variable being assigned to in the other assign statement,
it doesn't work very well.

### What is the meaning of always @(*) in a sensitivity block?
The always @(*) means that the sensitivity block should change when the signal in the @(*) changes.

### What importance is memory to digital circuits?
It allows for data to be saved even when the inputs change. It keeps the previous or current state whereas without memory the outputs change immidetly after your inputs change.
