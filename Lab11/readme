## Lab Questions

### What is different between edge and level sensitive circuits?
An edge sensitive circuit is where the output changes only on the edge of enable to follow what data is doing.
A level sensitive circuit is where the output follows data when enable is on.

### Why is it important to declare initial state?
It is important to declare the initial state because the FPGA doesn't know what values are there to begin with.

### What do edge sensitive circuits let us build?
Edge sensitive circuits let us build
