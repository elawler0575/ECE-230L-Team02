# Lab 05 - Combinatorial Logic

Annika Camarillo
Emaline Lawler

In this lab, you’ve learned real world applications of digital logic, as well
as how to assemble your own Verilog modules. In addition, you’ve learned how
the constraints file maps your inputs and outputs to real pins on the FPGA.

## Summary
In this lab, we learned about Verilog syntax and how to use the top.v file as a breadboard to connect modules together. We also learned about that the constraints.xdc file is necessary so Vivado understands where the componnents are on the FPGA.

## Lab Questions

### 1 - Explain the role of the Top Level file.
The top level file is the breadboard where you connect/wire all your modules and bits together.

### 2 - Explain the function of the Constraints file.
The Constraints file tells Vivado where the pins are located and assigns the function to each pin used, so the FPGA can use/respond to the correct pins. 
The Constraints file allows a common name between the FPGA and Vivado, as Vivado knows a switch as sw[] and the FPGA knows a switch as a location on the board.

### 3 - Was the selection of Minterm and Maxterm correct for each circuit? What would you have chosen?
For circuit a, Maxterm was not the most efficient way in terms of the process of grouping the zeros. Minterms only has one group of ones, which simplifies the process. For circuit b, minterms optimizes the circuit the most, so we would stick with that for this circuit.
