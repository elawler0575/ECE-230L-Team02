## Lab Questions

### In plain English describe the function and use of a multiplexer.
A multiplexer takes multiple inputs and selects a single output from one of the inputs. 
A multiplexer can be used to take multiple signals and choose an output to send to the CPU or memory.

### In plain English describe the function and use of a demultiplexer.
A demultiplexer takes one input and makes multiple outputs.
A demultiplexer can be used to send a single signal to multple places.

### What other uses might these circuits have? (Think Shannonâ€™s)
These circuits can simplify large truth tables to make it easier to get the logic equation.
